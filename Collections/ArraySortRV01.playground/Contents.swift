/* 
The sorted() function -

Swiftâ€™s standard library provides a function called sorted, which sorts an array of values of a known type, based on the output of a sorting closure that you provide. Once it completes the sorting process, the sorted function returns a new array of the same type and size as the old one, with its elements in the correct sorted order. The original array is not modified by the sorted function.
